# Antenna Array Visualizer

A simple desktop application to calculate and visualize the radiation pattern of linear antenna arrays. This project was developed for the Electromagnetism course (22.21) at Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires (ITBA).

## Features

*   Calculate the radiation pattern for a linear array of isotropic antennas.
*   Customize the number of antennas (N).
*   Adjust the separation between antennas in fractions of a wavelength (d/λ).
*   Display the resulting Array Factor in a real-time polar plot.
